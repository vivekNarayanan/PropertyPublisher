Problem Statement

Managing Properties and configuration of an application has become a tedious task with the increasing number of implementations on load balancers enabled environment.

Making a change in configuration becomes a nightmare, because each server in the environment has to be brought down.

In some occasion even rebuilding of the application is required if the configuration is inside the jar.

Location of the Property file and the content of the property file is visible to all and its predictable too.
